         <p class="large-8 medium-12 small-12 columns"> A cartoonist is an artist who creates animated cartoons manually or on the computer. This can be for magazines, newspapers, publishing companies, television and film studios, videos, gaming companies and animation studios. Their work may also be used in political commentary, comic strips, installation guides and user manuals. A cartoonist is more specialized than an illustrator in that they only deal with animated characters, whereas an illustrator may deal with several specialties.</p>

        <h3 class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns">What does a Cartoonist do? </h3>
         <p> Many cartoonists use digital tools to draw their cartoons, though there are many that still use paper and pencil/pen that are later scanned. A cartoonist may accept commissioned work, or develop their own work to be sent out to publications. They may also work on full-length books or a series rather than individual cartoons. Some cartoonists turn comic strips in regularly for publication and are able to have some job security. Some publishing houses also keep cartoonists on staff to work in an office environment. Being a cartoonist demands high creativity, as he/she has to create new and clever ideas consistently. </p>

        <h3 class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 columns"> How to Become a Cartoonist. </h3>
         <p> Typically, a cartoonist starts drawing at an early age, developing their own style in a certain area of interest, like politics for example. Many cartoonists are freelancers, and use their portfolio and established reputation to secure employment, but can also work in an office environment as part of a cartooning staff. Like any artist, securing a job will depend on his or her level of skill, and it may take years to build up enough clientele to have a steady source of income.</p>
         <br>
         <p> Cartoonists generally have a bachelorâ€™s degree in animation, graphic design, or fine arts, which will teach the student multi-dimensional drawing, concepts, and theories. A concentration in cartooning coursework is advisable. Admission into an arts program or school typically requires the applicant to submit a portfolio showcasing his or her best work. </p>
         <br>
         <p> While art school teaches students the theories of illustration, another very important aspect of being a cartoonist is writing. Characters in a cartoon strip series, for example, have their own life, therefore the cartoonist will provide a narrative and identifiable personalities for readers to relate to.</p>
