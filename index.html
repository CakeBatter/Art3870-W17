        <h3 class="large-12 columns"> What is a Cartoonist? </h2>
         <p class="large-8 columns"> A cartoonist is an artist who creates animated cartoons manually or on the computer. This can be for magazines, newspapers, publishing companies, television and film studios, videos, gaming companies and animation studios. Their work may also be used in political commentary, comic strips, installation guides and user manuals. A cartoonist is more specialized than an illustrator in that they only deal with animated characters, whereas an illustrator may deal with several specialties.</p>

        <h3 class="large-12 columns">What does a Cartoonist do? </h3>
         <p> Many cartoonists use digital tools to draw their cartoons, though there are many that still use paper and pencil/pen that are later scanned. A cartoonist may accept commissioned work, or develop their own work to be sent out to publications. They may also work on full-length books or a series rather than individual cartoons. Some cartoonists turn comic strips in regularly for publication and are able to have some job security. Some publishing houses also keep cartoonists on staff to work in an office environment. Being a cartoonist demands high creativity, as he/she has to create new and clever ideas consistently. </p>
